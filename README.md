# Python-Programming
python
This repository contains my Python programming assignment solutions from the IITM BSc Data Science & Applications program. It covers the fundamentals of Python starting from basic conditionals and loops, moving through functions, data structures (lists, sets, dictionaries), comprehensions, functional programming tools like map/filter/zip, 2D matrix problems, object oriented programming, and a brief introduction to NumPy. Each file has the original question as a comment at the top followed by the solution code.
